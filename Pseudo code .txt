Pseudo code :

M -> number of generations
N -> population size
p_c -> probability of crossover
p_m -> probability of mutation
k -> tournament selection "number of contestants"
l -> lenght of chromosome


1) Set parameters M,N,p_c,p_m and k 
2) Create N population randomly of string size l
3) m = 1 and n = 1
4) Select 2 parents through selection method
5) Crossover the parents' genes to get children
6) Mutate children
7) n = n +1 & Repeat steps 4 - 6 N/2 times 
8) Get new generation of mutated children
9) m = m + 1 & Repeat steps 4 - 9 M times
10) Choose best fitness value from last generation or keep track of best chromosome in each generation for final answer
